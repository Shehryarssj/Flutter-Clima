Clima is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). The app can obtain the current location of the device and show the weather data accordingly.
Clima leverages the open weather map api to create a functional yet beautiful user interface. Just add your apiKey into the loading_screen.dart file to get started.
